# PickUpAndHaul Mod Development Guide for ChatGPT Codex

## Project Overview

PickUpAndHaul is a RimWorld mod that allows colonists to gather items in their inventory and haul them to stockpiles, significantly improving hauling efficiency. The mod enables pawns to carry multiple items at once instead of just one item per trip.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow C# conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Implement proper error handling

### RimWorld Integration
- Use Harmony for patches
- Follow RimWorld's job system patterns
- Implement proper save/load compatibility
- Handle mod compatibility gracefully

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use object pooling where appropriate
- Profile performance-critical sections
- Implement proper cleanup in job drivers

### Testing
- Test with different RimWorld versions
- Verify compatibility with popular mods
- Test save/load functionality
- Validate performance impact

## Common Patterns

### Job Driver Pattern
```csharp
public class JobDriver_Example : JobDriver
{
    public override IEnumerable<Toil> MakeNewToils()
    {
        // Define job steps
        yield return Toils_Goto.GotoThing(TargetIndex.A, PathEndMode.ClosestTouch);
        yield return new Toil { /* action */ };
    }
}
```

### Component Pattern
```csharp
public class CompExample : ThingComp
{
    public override void PostSpawnSetup(bool respawningAfterLoad)
    {
        base.PostSpawnSetup(respawningAfterLoad);
        // Initialize component
    }
}
```

### Harmony Patch Pattern
```csharp
[HarmonyPatch(typeof(TargetClass), "TargetMethod")]
public static class PatchClass
{
    public static void Postfix(/* parameters */)
    {
        // Post-patch logic
    }
}
```

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build dependency first
cd Source/IHoldMultipleThings && dotnet build

# Build main mod
cd Source/PickUpAndHaul && dotnet build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Assembly Loading**: Ensure all dependencies are properly referenced
2. **Harmony Patches**: Verify patch targets exist in target RimWorld version
3. **Save Compatibility**: Test save/load with and without mod
4. **Performance**: Profile mod impact on game performance

### Debug Tools
- Use `DebugLog.cs` for logging
- Enable performance profiling
- Check Harmony patch application
- Verify XML definition loading

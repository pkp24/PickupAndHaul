# PickUpAndHaul Reservation System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a custom reservation system to PickUpAndHaul that **completely bypasses RimWorld's broken vanilla reservation system** for PUAH hauling jobs. The vanilla system has a critical bug where `CanReserve` returns `False` even when all conditions are met and no existing reservations exist, causing infinite loops and job failures.

## The Core Problem: RimWorld Engine Bug
After extensive debugging, we discovered that RimWorld's vanilla reservation system has a fundamental bug:
- `WorkGiver.CanReserve()` returns `True` for valid storage locations
- `JobDriver.CanReserve()` returns `False` for the same locations with identical parameters
- `ReservationManager` reports zero existing reservations
- This creates an "impossible state" that causes infinite job loops

## Current Solution: Custom PUAH Reservation System

### Key Features

1. **Complete Vanilla Bypass**
   - Uses `PUAHReservationManager` for all PUAH hauling jobs
   - Only uses vanilla reservation system to inform vanilla about our reservations (preventing conflicts)
   - Detects the RimWorld bug and bypasses it entirely

2. **Dual Reservation Tracking**
   - **PUAH Reservations**: Internal tracking of our custom reservations
   - **Vanilla Reservations**: Made alongside PUAH reservations to prevent vanilla jobs from conflicting
   - Both systems are cleaned up together when jobs end

3. **Bug Detection and Bypass**
   - Detects when vanilla `CanReserve` fails but no vanilla reservations exist
   - Automatically assumes the location IS reservable for PUAH jobs
   - Logs the bug detection for debugging

4. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - Reservations are released when jobs end via Harmony patches
   - Prevents memory leaks and stale reservations

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created

1. **PUAHReservationManager.cs**
   - Core custom reservation system that bypasses vanilla bugs
   - Tracks both PUAH and vanilla reservations
   - Implements bug detection and bypass logic
   - Methods: `CanReserve`, `Reserve`, `Release`, `ReleaseAllForPawn`, `IsReservedBy`

### Modified Files

1. **WorkGiver_HaulToInventory.cs**
   - Uses `PUAHReservationManager.CanReserve()` for cells
   - Still uses vanilla `pawn.CanReserve()` for things (containers)
   - Bypasses the RimWorld engine bug for storage cells

2. **JobDriver_HaulToInventory.cs**
   - Uses `PUAHReservationManager.Reserve()` for cells
   - Uses `PUAHReservationManager.ReserveThing()` for items
   - Falls back to vanilla reservation if PUAH fails
   - Handles both targetA (storage) and targetB (haul items) reservations

3. **HarmonyPatches.cs**
   - Added `Pawn_JobTracker_EndCurrentJob_Patch` to clean up reservations
   - Uses `Prefix` instead of `Postfix` to ensure job is still available
   - Initializes PUAH reservation manager for all maps on game load

## How It Works Now

1. **WorkGiver Phase**:
   - Checks if storage location is reservable using PUAH system
   - If vanilla says "no" but no vanilla reservations exist â†’ assumes it's the bug and allows reservation
   - Creates job only if PUAH system says it's reservable

2. **JobDriver Phase**:
   - Uses PUAH reservation system for all reservations
   - Makes vanilla reservations alongside PUAH ones to prevent conflicts
   - If vanilla reservation fails, continues with PUAH reservation (bypassing the bug)

3. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - Harmony patch detects when PUAH jobs end
   - Releases both PUAH and vanilla reservations
   - Prevents memory leaks and stale reservations

## Failed Approaches (Comprehensive List)

### 1. Parameter Alignment Attempts
- **Problem**: WorkGiver and JobDriver used different `CanReserve` parameters
- **Attempts**: 
  - Aligned parameter counts and types
  - Used temporary jobs for validation
  - Tried different `maxPawns` and `stackCount` values
- **Result**: Failed - the bug persisted regardless of parameter alignment

### 2. Enhanced Logging and Debugging
- **Problem**: Needed to understand why reservations were failing
- **Attempts**:
  - Added extensive logging in both WorkGiver and JobDriver
  - Logged all `CanReserve` parameter combinations
  - Added detailed state inspection (cell contents, walkability, reachability)
- **Result**: Revealed the "impossible state" where vanilla logic was inconsistent

### 3. Storage Failure Tracker
- **Problem**: Pawns were repeatedly trying to reserve failed locations
- **Attempts**:
  - Implemented cooldown system for failed storage locations
  - Prevented immediate retry of failed reservations
- **Result**: Failed - didn't address the core bug, just delayed the inevitable

### 4. Alternative Storage Logic
- **Problem**: Primary storage locations were failing reservation
- **Attempts**:
  - Added fallback to find alternative storage locations
  - Pre-validated alternatives before attempting reservation
- **Result**: Failed - all storage locations suffered from the same bug

### 5. Nuclear Bypass Attempts
- **Problem**: Vanilla reservation was fundamentally broken
- **Attempts**:
  - Force `reservationSuccess = true` when bug was detected
  - Immediately `return true` from toils when bug detected
- **Result**: Failed - caused infinite job loops and game instability

### 6. Prevention Strategy
- **Problem**: Jobs were being created but failing during execution
- **Attempts**:
  - Detect bug in WorkGiver and `return false` to prevent job creation
  - Use `StoreUtility.TryFindBestBetterStorageFor` as fallback
- **Result**: Failed - prevented jobs from being created at all

### 7. Vanilla Fallback Strategy
- **Problem**: PUAH system was completely broken
- **Attempts**:
  - Use `HaulAIUtility.HaulToStorageJob` when bug detected
  - Revert to vanilla hauling behavior
- **Result**: Rejected by user - "completely negates what we are trying to do"

### 8. DLL Analysis and Decompilation
- **Problem**: Needed to understand vanilla reservation system internals
- **Attempts**:
  - Decompiled RimWorld DLLs to examine `CanReserve` and `Reserve` logic
  - Analyzed `ReservationManager` implementation
- **Result**: Confirmed the bug was in vanilla code, not our implementation

## Benefits of Current Solution

1. **Eliminates Infinite Loops**: No more stuck pawns in reservation failure loops
2. **Bypasses Vanilla Bug**: Works around the fundamental RimWorld engine issue
3. **Maintains Compatibility**: Still informs vanilla system to prevent conflicts
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles both PUAH and vanilla reservation failures
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Prevents memory leaks and stale reservations

## Example Scenario

**Before (Broken)**:
1. WorkGiver finds storage location and says `CanReserve: True`
2. JobDriver tries to reserve same location and gets `CanReserve: False`
3. Job fails with `JobCondition.Incompletable`
4. New job is created, creating infinite loop
5. Pawn gets stuck forever

**After (Fixed)**:
1. WorkGiver uses PUAH system, detects vanilla bug, allows reservation
2. JobDriver uses PUAH system, makes both PUAH and vanilla reservations
3. Job proceeds normally even if vanilla reservation fails
4. Reservations are cleaned up when job ends
5. Pawn successfully hauls items

## Technical Notes

- The system is designed to be robust against the vanilla bug while maintaining compatibility
- All PUAH-specific reservations are tracked separately from vanilla ones
- The bug detection logic is conservative - it only bypasses when there are truly no vanilla reservations
- Memory usage is minimal as reservations are cleaned up immediately when jobs end
